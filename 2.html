<h2>CHAPTER2</h2>
<h3>Word Became Flesh</h2>
<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
<br>The same was in the beginning with God. <br>;All things were made through him.
<br>Without him was not anything made that has been made.<br>In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
<br>The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn't overcome it.</p>
<p>There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John. <br>The same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all might believe through him. 
<br>He was not the light, but was sent that he might testify about the light.<br>He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world didn't recognize him.
<br>He came to his own, and those who were his own didn't receive him.<br>Bus as many as recieve him, to them he gave the right to become God's children, to those who believe in his name:
<br>who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</p>
<p>The word became flesh, and lived among us.<br>We saw his glory, such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.
<br>John testified about him. He cried saying "This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has surpaseed me, for he was before me.'"
