<h2>The Gospel According To John</h2>
<h3>What Is the Big Idea?</h3>
<p>While the other three gospels portray Jesus as the King, the Servant, and the Son of Man, John portrays Jesus as the Son of God. 
    John stated his theme more clearly than any of the other gospel writers. 
    He wrote so that his readers might “believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God,” so that they may have life in His name.</p>
<p>To accomplish that goal, John presented a riveting and distinctive picture of Jesus Christ, one in complete unity with the portraits in the other three gospels, 
    but one that also adds significantly to the Bible's revelation of Jesus Christ, the God-man.</p>
<p>John used a variety of techniques to communicate to his readers the nature of Jesus. 
    These include his citation of Jesus's seven “I am” statements, in which Jesus spoke of Himself in terms such as “the Light of the world” (8:12), 
    “the resurrection and the life” (11:25), and “the way, and the truth, and the life” (14:6). 
    Much of John's gospel (chapters 2-12) might be called the Book of Signs, 
    as it recounts Jesus's performing of seven different miracles—such as the turning water to wine at Cana and raising Lazarus from the dead at Bethany. 
    These miracles illustrate His identity as the Son of God. </p>
